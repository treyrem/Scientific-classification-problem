# ENHANCED CLASSIFICATION STRATEGY FOR DUAL ASSIGNMENTS:
classification_hierarchy:
  1: "Physical instrument → Lab_Equipment (HIGHEST PRIORITY)"
  2: "Antibody product → Antibodies"
  3: "assay kit → Assay_Kits"

mandatory_equipment_rules:
  rule_1: "Any product with 'system' in name → Lab_Equipment"
  rule_2: "Any product with 'machine' in name → Lab_Equipment"  
  rule_3: "Any product with 'reader' in name → Lab_Equipment"
  rule_4: "Any product with 'analyzer' in name → Lab_Equipment"
  rule_5: "Any product with 'cycler' in name → Lab_Equipment"
  rule_6: "Any product with 'sequencer' in name → Lab_Equipment"

dual_classification_rules:
  equipment_hierarchy:
    1: "Physical instruments → Lab_Equipment (primary)"
    2: "Application-specific equipment → Technique domain (secondary)"
    3: "Example: qPCR machine → Lab_Equipment + Molecular_Diagnostics"
  
  reagent_applications:
    1: "Product source/type → Source domain (primary)"
    2: "Primary application → Application domain (secondary)"
    3: "Example: BSA → Blood + Protein (biochemistry use)"
  
  technique_products:
    1: "Core reagent type → Reagent domain (primary)"
    2: "Technique application → Technique domain (secondary)"
    3: "Example: IHC antibody → Antibodies + Immunochemicals"

# SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:

implementation_priorities:
  high_priority_dual_classifications:
    - "NeuN antibodies: Antibodies + Cell_Biology"
    - "qPCR machines: Lab_Equipment + Molecular_Diagnostics"
    - "BSA: Blood + Protein"
    - "Cell viability assays: Assay_Kits + Cell_Biology"
    - "Gel documentation: Bioimaging_Microscopy + Nucleic_Acid_Electrophoresis"
  
  prompt_enhancements_needed:
    - "Add dual classification examples for equipment serving multiple domains"
    - "Clarify that reagent source vs application can justify dual classification"
    - "Emphasize that technique overlaps are opportunities, not conflicts"
