Lab Product Categorization: A Tale of Trials, Errors, and Occasional Triumphs

Welcome to the cringy chronicles of my attempts to categorize 10,000 hyper-specific in places not specific enough lab product names into "right categories" (or somewhat reasonable). Spoiler alert: it wasn’t pretty—but hey, at least it was educational.

🏁 Chapter 1: The Naïve Debut (main.py)

Armed with nothing but misplaced confidence, claude ai and GPT-3.5-turbo API, I threw main.py at the problem. I fed it a list of 35 life-science categories and prayed it wouldn’t slap everything into Other.

Method: Prompt the LLM with a flat list of categories, one shot per product.

Reality Check: Only ~3,000 of the 10,000 names got a real label. The other ~7,000 were banished to Other, aka failed.

Downsides:

Massive Other Herd: When in doubt, GPT piled it into Other.  

Zero Nuance: A single layer of categories is like using a spoon to eat steak—technically possible but deeply unsatisfying.

Token Limit SOS: Prompt length hit the roof, so I had to butcher my examples down to the bare bones.

🚀 Chapter 2: Humble Pie & Regex Band‑Aids (main_2.py + product_categorizer.py)

After sobering up from Chapter 1’s meltdown, I tried a two-step method:

main_2.py: Upgraded to a two-tier taxonomy (10 big buckets + subcategories), still in LLM hands. 

product_categorizer.py: When AI still bailed, I lunged in with regex rules to patch the holes.

Progress (kind of):

Regex Wins: Uncategorizables shrank from ~7,000 to ~700. Victory? Sort of.

Structured-ish: Two levels helped a bit—some categories even made sense.

Still Awful:

700 OTHERS.

15% Oops Moments: My “Mass Spec Reagent” category included Mass Spec itself for some reason. And “Cell Lines” occasionally meant live mice and rats.

🌟 Chapter 3: The (Semi-)Glorious Comeback (new_categorization.py)

At this point, I desperately needed a win. Enter new_categorization.py, the crown jewel I’m only moderately proud of:

Thorough categorization analysis of the market. Surely smarter people from big lab equipment companies made better categories than I can possibly think of. 

Three Tiers: Category → Subcategory → Sub-subcategory. Because if two levels aren’t enough, three will surely do the trick.

JSON-Strict Prompts: LLM spits out JSON. No more guessing if it meant “Protein” or “Proteins.”

Fallbacks That Don’t Scream for Help: Invalid entries auto-correct to the closest valid option.

Regex Only Where Needed: A lean set of overrides for those brand-specific oddballs.

Checkpointing & Logs: Finally, I can pause, check my shitty checkpoints, and resume without starting from scratch.

Honarable Mentions:

Strugglebussers? Practically Gone: Under 1% of names remain mischievous. 

Error Rate: Single-digit misclassifications. Let’s call it “good enough.”
