# MASTER CATEGORIES YAML - For Stage 1 Domain Identification
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 
# Purpose: Maps your detailed YAML files to simplified domains for efficient 
#          two-stage classification with minimal token usage
#
# Usage: Stage 1 uses this file to identify 1-2 broad domains
#        Stage 2 loads specific detailed YAML files for deep classification
